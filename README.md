# üöÄ EVE-BOOK : VM Reservation Module

## üìú Description

The VM reservation module allows users to book virtual machines (VMs) from an online calendar. Users can specify the date and number of hours for their reservation. The system checks the availability of VMs, creates a VM in the EVE-NG virtualization environment, and sends the SSH authentication parameters to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **VM Reservation**: Book VMs by selecting the date and duration from an interactive web interface.
- **Availability Check**: Ensure that no existing reservation overlaps with the specified date.
- **Automatic VM Creation**: Triggers the creation of a VM in EVE-NG.
- **SSH Parameters Sending**: Sends SSH authentication details to the user.
- **Theme Customization**: Adjust the theme and style of the interface according to your preferences.
- **Main Menu**: Modify the main menu to better fit your needs and enhance user experience.
- **User Profile Editing**: Allows users to update their personal information and manage their profile.
- **Interactive Dynamic Interface**: Enjoy a responsive and interactive user interface for a better experience.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Access an admin dashboard to manage reservations and users.
- **Upcoming Reservations Management**: View, modify, or cancel future reservations.
- **Reservation Archive Viewing**: Access a complete history of past reservations.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for the Express backend)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (for reservation management)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) (for VM creation)
- [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net) (virtualization environment)
- [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) (virtualization environment on Windows 11)

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/votre-utilisateur/votre-projet.git
   cd votre-projet
2. **Configure the backend** :

   - Navigate to the `api` directory and install the dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd api
     npm install
     ```

   - Create an `.env` file in the `api` directory for necessary environment variables:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/EVE-Book
     ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK_PATH=/root/ansible/playbooks/create_vm.yml
     ```

3. **Configure the frontend** :

   - Navigate to the `client` directory and install the dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

   - Configure the backend connection settings in the frontend configuration file.

4. **Configure Ansible** :

   - Ensure that the `Ansible` script for VM creation is correctly configured and accessible. Check the connection settings to EVE-NG and the disk image paths.

5. **Start the Server** :

   - Start the backend :

     ```bash
     cd ../api
     npm start
     ```

   - Start the frontend :

     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm start
     ```

# üîß Usage
